#Illustration-
#Rotate the array to left by one position. For that:
#  Store the first element of the array in a temporary variable.
#  Shift the rest of the elements in the original array by one place.
#  Update the last index of the array with the temporary variable.
#Repeat the above steps for the number of left rotations required.


# Function to left rotate arr[] of size n by d

def Rotate(arr, d, n):
p = 1
while(p <= d):
	last = arr[0]
	for i in range (n - 1):
	arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
	arr[n - 1] = last
	p = p + 1
	
  
def printArray(arr, size):
for i in range (size):
	print(arr[i] ,end = " ")
